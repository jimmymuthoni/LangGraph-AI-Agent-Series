      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to retrieve and incorporate new information. With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM's pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data. For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don't exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments.\n",
      "RAG also reduces the need to retrain LLMs with new data, saving on computational and financial costs. Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include sources in their responses, so users can verify the cited sources. This provides greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",

When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles). The name llama (also historically spelled \"lama\" or \"glama\") was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.\n",
      "The ancestors of llamas are thought to have originated on the Great Plains of North America about 40 million years ago and subsequently migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America. Some were imported to the United States and Canada late in the 20th century; their descendants now number more than 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas.\n",

It’s a way to connect with someone. When you ask it, you’re saying, “I see you, and I care about how you’re doing.”\\n\\nEven if the question seems small, it can open the door to deeper conversations or make someone feel valued.\\n\\nThe way you ask and answer this question depends on the situation. [...] “How are you?” isn’t used the same way everywhere. In some cultures, it’s just a polite greeting, and people don’t expect a real answer. In others, it’s an invitation to share. Here’s how it works in a few places:\\n\\n   United States: “How are you?” is often a casual greeting. Most people say “Good” or “Fine” unless they’re close friends.\\n\\n   United Kingdom: Similar to the U.S., it’s usually a polite question. People might say “Alright” or “Not bad.” [...] When someone asks, “How are you?” they usually expect a short, positive answer. If you’re doing well, you cansay:\\n\\n   “I’m good, thanks for asking!”\\n\\n   “Pretty great, actually!”\\n\\n   “Doing alright, how about you?”\\n\\nIf you’re not doing great, you don’t have to fake it, but keep it light unless you’re talking to someone close. For example:\\n\\n   “It’s been a rough day, but I’m hanging in there.”\\n\\n   “Not my best week, but thanks for asking.”\\n\\n   “Could be better, but I’ll manage.”', 'score': 0.8573986}, {'title': '201 Funny And Witty Responses To The Question \"How Are You?\"', 'url': 'https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/how-to-respond-to-how-are-you/', 'content': 'In some Middle Eastern countries, “How are you?” might be followed by questions about family and well-being, with answers expected to be more elaborate.\\n\\nIn professional or formal settings, especially in cultures like the U.S. or the U.K., “How are you?” is answered with, “I’m well, thank you.”\\n\\nThese cultural variations highlight how social norms shape not only the words we say but also the depth of connection and meaning we assign to them. [...] In professional settings, this question is typically a polite inquiry. Additionally, in times of stress or crisis, asking “How are you?” can take on a more empathetic tone, showing a desire to check in on someone’s emotional state. Therefore, understanding when and how to use this phrase can help you deal with social interactions with greater sensitivity to context and social etiquette. [...] The phrase “How are you?” is a common greeting, but its intent can vary depending on the context in which it is used. Diane Darling, a renowned speaker, instructor and author says, “Context is how I recommend that people respond to the question ‘how are you’. Is the person someone you know well? Acquaintance? Neighbor? Family members? Is the question about something that recently happened (job promotion, death in the family) or is it a cordiality?

    "A Tool Calling Agent refers to an AI system or framework that dynamically invokes external tools or APIs to accomplish tasks as part of its decision-making process. Instead of relying solely on internal reasoning or knowledge, the agent calls specific tools to perform actions like calculations, searches, or other operations. This type of agent is often used in real-world applications where tasks require interaction with external systems."

See how to use it on your desktop today.\\n\\n4 min read\\nAug 1, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLMs have paved the way for the development of new types of agentic applications — and as LLM applications evolve, so must the tooling needed to efficiently develop them. Today, we're announcing LangGraph Studio - the first IDE designed specifically for agent development - in open beta.LangGraph Studio offers a new way to develop LLM applications, providing a specialized agent IDE for visualizing, interacting with, and debugging complex agentic applications. In this blog, we'll give a brief overview of LangGraph and then explore how LangGraph Studio streamlines the development of agentic applications.LangGraph: Balancing agent control with agency  In January 2023, we launched LangGraph, a highly controllable, low-level orchestration framework for building agentic applications. Since then, we've seen  teams build more complex agentic applications for production; in turn, we've heavily invested in LangGraph, leading to a stable 0.1 release this past June.LangGraph features a persistence layer that enables human-in-the-loop interactions, and it excels at building complex (i.e. more than a single LLM call) applications that require highly domain-specific cognitive architecture. Most of the agents we see in production fit this description.LangGraph is fully open source, available in both Python and Javascript. It works with or without LangChain, and integrates seamlessly with LangSmith.LangGraph Studio: Visualize and interact with agent graphs for quick iterationWhile LangGraph offers a new framework for developing agentic applications, we also strongly believe that new tooling is needed to make the development process easier. Building LLM applications differs from traditional software development, requiring different tooling outside of the traditional code editor.Coding is still important to developing LLM applications — after all, production-ready LangGraph applications have complicated custom logic in the nodes and edges of the graphs that are created. We don't aim to replace code editors but, instead, to augment the development experience with tools tailored for LangGraph applications. LangGraph Studio facilitates this by making it easy to visualize and interact with agent graphs, even if development still primarily happens in code. Visualizing graphs helps developers understand their structure. Furthermore, you can modify an agent result (or the logic underlying a specific node) halfway through the agent's trajectory. This creates an iterative process, by letting you interact with and manipulate the state at that point in time.While there is much more to explore, we're excited to introduce LangGraph Studio to start with bringing some of the core features of an agent IDE to the world.How to use LangGraph StudioLangGraph Studio is a desktop app, currently available for Apple Silicon. You can download a version here. Support for more platforms is coming soon.After you download and open LangGraph Studio, you will be prompted to log in with your LangSmith account. All users of LangSmith (including those with free accounts) currently have access to LangGraph Studio while it is in beta. You can sign up for a LangSmith account here.After downloading LangSmith, you can open a directory. At a bare minimum, this directory needs to contain a Python file with a graph defined in it. Next, you will need to create a langgraph.json file containing details such as where the agent is defined, which dependencies to install, and which environment variables to load. This file can be created in the UI, or can exist as a file in the directory already. For an example repository which meets these requirements, see this GitHub repo.After you open a directory, we will build an environment for you agent to run. After it builds, you should see a visualization of the graph along with a box for interacting with the agent.When you interact with the agent, you'll get a stream of real-time information about what steps are happening. You can see the agent decide which tools to call, call those tools, and then continue looping. You can interrupt the agent at any time if veers off course, or you can interrupt the agent to run it in a “debug mode” where it pauses after each step of the graph (so you can walk-through step by step).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:19\\n\\n\\n1×\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n💡At any point, you can interact with the state of the agent.If you don’t like what the agent responded with at a specific step, you can directly modify the response and then continue with that new response. This can be useful for simulating what would have happened if the agent or a tool returned something different.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:14\\n\\n\\n1×\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can also modify the underlying code and then replay the node. LangGraph Studio detects changes to the underlying code files, allowing you to update prompts in your code editor and rerun nodes if an agent responds poorly. This can make it much easier to iterate on long-running agents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:20\\n\\n\\n1×\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusionBuilding agentic applications differs from traditional software development. While code editors remain important, new IDEs designed for agents are also needed. LangGraph Studio is a step in this direction, and we're excited to see how it enhances your workflow.For more on LangGraph Studio, check out our documentation.
