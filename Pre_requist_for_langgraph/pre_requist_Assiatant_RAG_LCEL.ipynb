[...] Overnight on Saturday, Israel targeted Iran’s defence ministry headquarters in Tehran, while footage showed a blaze raging at the nearby Shahran oil depot.\\n\\nAround a million people were forced into air raid shelters as sirens were heard in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Nearly 200 were wounded and six killed in a strike on an eight-storey building in Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv, officials said. Four civilians were also reported dead in the predominantly Palestinian town of Tamra. [...] But Israel insisted just seven out of fewer than 100 missiles fired by Iran overnight had landed in Israel.
